		<h1> Chapter 2: Analyzing sequences </h1>

		<p>When you first saw the sequence 1 5 14 ..., the process of taking the differences might have seemed quite arbitrary. As this approach worked for this particular sequence, the natural is whether this works generally. <em>What happens to other sequences when you apply forward difference to them? Or what if you apply it multiple times?</em></p>
		<p>You've seen at the end of the last chapter, that taking forward differences of a polynomial sequence results in another polynomial sequence (which is true in general, but you'll get to this), albeit it may be computationally quite cumbersome, especially for large polynomials. Now it's time to answer the second question - the process of applying differences to multiple times is often denoted <i>&Delta<sup>k</sup></i>.</p>

				<h4> Problem 2.1 </h4>
			</div>
			<p> Let the sequence 0 1 5 14 ... be denoted <i>a</i>. Compute <i>&Delta;<sup>k</sup>(a)</i> for all <i>k</i>. </p>
			<div class="solution">
				<p> <em> The solution displays when you hover above it. </em> </p>
				
				<div class="hidden-solution">
					<p> <i>&Delta;(a)<sub>i</sub> = i<sup>2</sup></i> as you've seen.</p>
					<p> <i>&Delta;<sup>2</sup>(a)<sub>i</sub> = 2i+1</i></p>
					<p> <i>&Delta;<sup>3</sup>(a)<sub>i</sub> = 2</i></p>
					<p> <i>&Delta;<sup>k</sup>(a)<sub>i</sub> = 2</i> for all <i>k>3</i>.</p>

			<p>Interesting. After applying the difference four times, the sequence wanished and all there is left are zeros. <em>Is it just a coincidence? Or a general phenomenon?</em> You might intuitively see that this shouldn't be the case for all the sequences. Somehow there shouldn't be enough degrees of freedom. But can you prove it? </p>

				<h4> Problem 2.2 </h4>
			</div>
			<p>Find an example of a sequence whose <i>k</i>-th difference is never zero.</p>
			<div class="solution">
				<p> <em> The solution displays when you hover above it. </em> </p>
				
				<div class="hidden-solution">
					<p>Perhaps the easiest way how to find such sequence is to find a nonzero seqence which does not change when you apply forward difference to it. If you find it, than its difference can never be zero. If you set <i>a<sub>0</sub> = 1</i>, you find that the sequence of powers of two fullfils these constrains.</p>

			<p>After verifiying that there are sequences which never become zero, the natural follow up is <em>which sequences do terminate?</em> You could dive into the swamp of computations and find the answer, but it might be easier to first find sequences which behave nicely.</p>
			<p>What does it mean to behave <em>nicely</em>? Firstly, it should be possible to turn it into a sequence of zeros by applying multiple forward differences. Secondly, it should be easy to compute their differences (and best of all there partial sums as well). The last example from the previous chapter does not fullfil this as it was not possible to see the solution at a glance (athough it wasn't difficult to compute it).</p>
			<p>This was not very concrete indeed. The only way how to tackle this is try to spot a pattern. Let's write the desired function with its difference into a table.</p>
			<table>

			</table>
			<p>Adding a value from the bottom row to a value from the upper row gives the next number in that row. Sounds familiar? No? What if you rotate the table?</p>
			<image>

			</image>
			<p>That look just like a part of Pascal's triangle! The rows in our original table play the role of the diagonals in Pascal's triangle. But you know that the <i>k</i>-th diagonal (or rather antidiagonal) represents the sequence of binomial coefficients <span class="big">(</span> <i><span class="sub-sup"><sup>n</sup><sub>k</sub></i> <span class="big">)</span>. </p>
