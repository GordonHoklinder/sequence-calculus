		<p> This web tries to explain some math topics I found interesting and are rather not widely known in an accessible way. </p>
		<p> At this moment it is only the topic of <strong> sequence calculus </strong>, particularly the <strong> differences </strong> and <strong> partial sums </strong> of sequences.  </p>
