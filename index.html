		<h1> Short introduction to the calculus of sequences </h1>
		<p>This short book tries to cover the basics of the calculus of sequences as I believe this intriguing topic remains underapriciated, especially compared to its continuous counterpart. I myself am not an expert in this area, therefore the book tries to be rather shallow and focuses on intuitive explanation of the topics. </p>
